# Hyperbolic VQ-VAE

## Overview

Hyperbolic space is well fit to reduce the dimensionality of codebook vectors in VQ-VAEs. 
This repo implements training hyperbolic VQ-VAEs and benchmarks performance on various tasks.

This is the final project for 9.58: Projects in the Science of Intelligence at MIT in the fall of 2022.
